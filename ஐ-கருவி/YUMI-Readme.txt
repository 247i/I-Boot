Background of YUMI (Your Universal Multiboot Integrator):

YUMI is an easy to use tool created using NSIS. The purpose of YUMI is to help automate the creation of a bootable USB Flash Drive that can be used to boot multiple Linux based distributions (one at a time).
The end result should be a bootable USB Flash drive that will get you up and running with your chosen Live Distributions, all without having to do the research and perform the steps by hand. 

How YUMI Works:
ஐ - பல துவக்கம் கருவி
YUMI utilizes a Syslinux MBR to make the chosen drive bootable. Distributions are extracted using 7zip to the multiboot folder on the USB device, and a custom syslinux.cfg file along with distro independant configuration files are used to boot each distribution. Grub4DOS grub.exe may also be used to boot ISO files directly.
